Project 1

Algorithm:

Define the ocean rising rate.
Create an array for the years (5, 7, 10).
Loop through each year, calculate the increase, and display the result.

Pseudocode:

SET risingRate = 1.5
SET years = [5, 7, 10]
FOR each year in years DO
    increase = risingRate * year
    PRINT increase
END FOR

Reflection:

Challenges: Understanding how to loop through arrays and perform calculations
Problems Encountered: Ensuring correct data types for the calculations 
Learning: How to code:)

Project 2

Algorithm:

Define the tank size and MPG for town and highway.
Calculate distances for both scenarios.
Display the results.

Pseudocode:

SET tankSize = 20
SET townMpg = 23.5
SET highwayMpg = 28.9
townDistance = tankSize * townMpg
highwayDistance = tankSize * highwayMpg
PRINT distances

Reflection:

Challenges: Applying the formula correctly to calculate distances
Problems Encountered: Managing float values for precision in calculations
Learning: How to code:)

Project 3

Algorithm:

Define total customers and purchase percentages.
Calculate customers purchasing energy drinks and those preferring citrus.
Display results.

Pseudocode:

SET totalCustomers = 16500
SET percentPurchase = 0.15
SET percentCitrus = 0.58
customersPurchasing = totalCustomers * percentPurchase
customersCitrus = customersPurchasing * percentCitrus
PRINT results

Reflection:

Challenges: Handling percentages and translating them into calculations.
Problems Encountered: Ensuring accuracy in arithmetic operations.
Learning: How to code:)
